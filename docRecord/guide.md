When you’re developing a system (like a website, app, or backend service), you’ll need **different types of documents** to **plan, track, and record your work**. These help you stay organized, make it easy to communicate with others (or your future self), and ensure the system is maintainable.

Here’s **how you can write these documents**, with examples and templates for each.

---

## 1. **Project Planning Document (System Proposal)**

Purpose: To plan **what you’re building** before you start coding.

**Sections to include:**

* **Project Name & Overview** – What’s the system? Why does it exist?
* **Goals** – What problems does it solve? Who uses it?
* **Features List** – Core features (e.g., login, booking, admin dashboard).
* **Technology Stack** – Framework (Next.js, SQL Server, etc.), backend, hosting.
* **Timeline** – Major milestones (MVP, testing, release).
* **Team/Responsibilities** (even if it’s just you).

*Template Example*:

```
# Meriton Parking System – Project Plan

## Overview
A web-based parking booking and payment platform for Meriton hotels.

## Goals
- Allow hotel guests to pre-book parking spots.
- Automate payment calculation and receipts.

## Features
1. User login (hotel guest or admin)
2. Parking spot booking system
3. Dynamic pricing calculation (hourly, overnight)
4. Admin dashboard (reports, analytics)

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: Microsoft SQL Server
- Deployment: Azure

## Timeline
Week 1: Setup & Database  
Week 2: Booking & Pricing Module  
Week 3: Admin Dashboard  
Week 4: Testing & Deployment
```

---

## 2. **Technical Design Document**

Purpose: Explain **how the system is structured** (architecture).

**Sections to include:**

* **System Architecture Diagram** – Boxes & arrows (frontend, API, DB).
* **Database Design** – ER diagrams, tables, relationships.
* **APIs** – Endpoints, request/response formats.
* **Data Flow** – How data moves through the system.
* **Security & Backup** (if needed).

*Mini Example*:

```
# Booking API (POST /bookings)
Request:
{
  "userId": 123,
  "startTime": "2025-07-24T10:00",
  "endTime": "2025-07-24T15:00"
}
Response:
{
  "bookingId": 456,
  "price": 50.00
}
```

---

## 3. **Development Log (Daily/Weekly Notes)**

Purpose: To **track your work** day by day.

Write this like a **diary** of your progress so you don’t forget what you did.

*Template*:

```
# Dev Log – Week 1

2025-07-23:
- Set up Next.js project
- Installed Prisma & connected to SQL Server
- Created User table (id, name, email)

2025-07-24:
- Built login API
- Fixed bug: session not persisting (caused by missing cookie config)
- Next: build booking form
```

---

## 4. **Testing Document**

Purpose: Record **how you test your system**.

*Template*:

```
# Parking System – Test Plan

Feature: Booking Calculation
Test: Book for 1h 30min  
Expected: $10 charge (first hour free)  
Result: PASS (matches calculation)

Feature: Login
Test: Enter wrong password  
Expected: Error message  
Result: FAIL (system crashes) -> Bug ticket created
```

---

## 5. **User Guide / README**

Purpose: So **others (or future you)** can run and use the system.

*Sections:*

* How to install
* How to run locally
* Login credentials (test accounts)
* Features overview

---

### **How to Organize All This**

* Store them in your project folder (e.g., `/docs/`)
* Use **Markdown (`.md`) files** so they’re easy to read in GitHub.
* Keep each document short and updated.
